## ATTENTION THIS IS *NOT* AN R SCRITP
# A quick cheat-sheet for working with Git and GitHub
# My own REPO:
https://github.com/<youruser>/R.git

# Settings, email MUST be the same as the one on GITHUB:
git config --global user.name "<youruser>"
git config --global user.email "<youremail@mail.com>"
# Confirm changes:
git config ???list

# Choose a directory to use as REPO:
cd /Users/nico/Documents/R_Repo
# Initialize a REPO in the current directory:
git init
# Linking the local REPO to the GITHUB Repo:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<youruser>/R.git
# Checking that too:
git ls-remote


# Note: To clone a REPO on GITHUB to the current directory:
git clone https://github.com/<youruser>/R.git


# You???ll need to first sync the remote GitHub data to your directory
git pull origin master

# Then only, you can add the files you create locally to GitHub
# Add all files in the folder to your local REPO follow-up
git add .
# Add tracking to files changes (removed, renamed???)
git add -u
# Then commit the change, commenting it better even:
git commit -m "Test upload to GitHub???
# And finally, sync the changes in local Repo to remote one:
git push -u origin master
