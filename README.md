# R

## Why this page

R is the one language I somehow came to prefer over others (in spite of Python being possibly a more logical choice (at the very least, for CUDA and because it is more versatile...))

But with R and RStudio, I am usually set.

## What's here?

Just some "demo" code. In R, obviously.

I created this GitHub account some years ago, maybe in 2015, back then it was only a requirement for a Coursera DataScience course, and then forgot about it for some time... But coming back to it, it seems like a good place to post "demo code", and if anything, as a backup (No confidential data here...).

Some of it will be useful, most are just pieces that I derived from (great) code of others (I shall always reference the source, when applicable).

## What you will need to use this

Well, for instance, a working R interpreter, and probably an IDE.

(You can find a proposal (Dockerfile) somewhere under this GitHub account.)

## Warranty

None whatsoever. This is just source code offered as-is.

The code was written by me, but using many times libraries (or code from others, which I then shall mention) that I found (very) useful. (Nobody writes machine-level code anymore, and libraries, StackOverFlow & al. are all things I wouldn't be able to code without, I'll admit that much...)

## Conclusions

I hope this comes handy to someone someday. No expectations, this is just another source, not even meaning to say a good one... :)
